Me:

I have an old Ruby on Rails project that is using rails version 4.2.8 and ruby version 2.6.6.  It won't run on my M1 Mac anymore because ruby 2.6.6 won't compile for arch64.  I want to create a Linux docker container using x86 and ruby version 2.6.6, so I can run the container on my Mac without having to upgrade the project itself.  Please let me know if this is feasible.  If so, please explain how in a paragraph, then give me detailed step by step instructions with the exact commands needed to do it.  Note that the project uses a Postgres database which will run outside the docker container.  Also, note that I am using Colima, not Docker Desktop, so all docker commands should be CLI.

## Claude:

This approach is indeed feasible and can be an effective way to run your older Ruby on Rails project on your M1 Mac without modifying the project itself. By creating a Linux-based Docker container using an x86 architecture, you can emulate the environment needed for your application. Docker's ability to run x86 containers on ARM-based machines (like your M1 Mac) through emulation makes this possible. The process involves creating a Dockerfile that specifies the base image, Ruby version, and necessary dependencies, then building and running the container with the appropriate settings to connect to your external Postgres database.

Here are the detailed step-by-step instructions with the exact commands needed:

1. Create a new directory for your Docker setup:
   ```
   mkdir rails_docker && cd rails_docker
   ```

2. Create a Dockerfile:
   ```
   touch Dockerfile
   ```

3. Open the Dockerfile in your preferred text editor and add the following content:
   ```
   FROM --platform=linux/amd64 ruby:2.6.6

   RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y nodejs postgresql-client

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY Gemfile /app/Gemfile
   COPY Gemfile.lock /app/Gemfile.lock

   RUN bundle install

   COPY . /app

   CMD ["rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
   ```

4. Copy your Rails project's Gemfile and Gemfile.lock into the same directory as the Dockerfile.

5. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t boxes4_ruby_2_6_6 .
   ```

6. Run the container, mapping the necessary ports and setting environment variables for database connection:
   ```
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
     -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@host.docker.internal:5432/database_name \
     -v $(pwd):/app \
     --platform linux/amd64 \
     boxes4_ruby_2_6_6
   ```

   Replace `username`, `password`, and `database_name` with your actual Postgres credentials.

7. Access your Rails application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

Notes:
- Ensure that Colima is running before executing Docker commands.
- The `host.docker.internal` in the database URL allows the container to connect to services on your host machine.
- You may need to adjust your `config/database.yml` file in your Rails project to use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
- If you need to run Rails or Rake commands, you can do so using:
  ```
  docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID rails command
  ```
  or
  ```
  docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID rake command
  ```
  Replace `CONTAINER_ID` with the actual ID of your running container, which you can find using `docker ps`.

This setup should allow you to run your Ruby 2.6.6 and Rails 4.2.8 project on your M1 Mac using Docker and Colima.

## Database URL

To adjust your `config/database.yml` file to use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, you'll need to modify its contents. This change allows your Rails application to connect to the database using the environment variable we set when running the Docker container. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your `config/database.yml` file in a text editor.

2. Replace the contents of the file with the following:

```yaml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>

development:
  <<: *default

test:
  <<: *default

production:
  <<: *default
```

This configuration does the following:

- It sets up a default configuration that uses the `postgresql` adapter.
- It uses the `url` key to specify the database connection string.
- The `<%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>` syntax tells Rails to use the value of the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
- The same configuration is used for all environments (development, test, and production) by referencing the default settings.

3. Save the file.

With this configuration, your Rails application will use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable we set when running the Docker container (`-e DATABASE_URL=postgres://boxes:yamaha@host.docker.internal:5432/boxes4_development`).

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://boxes:yamaha@localhost:5432/boxes4_development
```

This approach has several advantages:

1. It's more secure because you're not hardcoding database credentials in your configuration file.
2. It's more flexible, allowing you to easily switch between different databases or database servers by just changing the environment variable.
3. It follows the twelve-factor app methodology, which recommends storing config in the environment.

Remember, when you're running your application outside of Docker (e.g., in your local development environment), you'll need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable accordingly. You can do this by running:

```
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name
```

Replace `username`, `password`, and `database_name` with your actual Postgres credentials.

This setup allows your Rails application to connect to the database whether it's running in Docker or directly on your host machine, as long as the correct `DATABASE_URL` is provided.
